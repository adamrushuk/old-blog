					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, I can confirm it&#039;s just a case of forwarding the port (443 in my case) from your router to the Secure Gateway server IP.

This is the command I ran on my Cisco 877W router:

ip nat inside source static tcp 10.10.10.202 443 &lt;External IP&gt; 443 extendable

To be honest, I couldn&#039;t run any apps, as the certificate auth fails (mine was originally for xensg01.vilab.local), but it logged in enough to see the available apps, so I know it would work if I created a matching certificate for external use.

Hope that helps :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tested this at my home lab yet, but I&#039;ll look into it for you shortly, as I&#039;m waist-deep in MSSQL stuff at the mo. It should be a simple case of port forwarding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am wanting to acess my lab farm from the internet which is running in vmware workstation on my home pc my servers are using bridged networking in vmware so have the same IP range as my normal machines eg 192.168.0.*

I understand fully about installing and configuring secure gateway /web interface and then using a ssl cert but i am strugling with the network config for this home enviroment

Do i place the secure gateway / web interface in the dmz on my router ?? Do i have to open certain ports to get it to work ?]]></description>
