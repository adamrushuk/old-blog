					<description><![CDATA[Working all night on this problem, I figured it was probably some obscure solution like this. Google is a friend indeed.
Many thanks, you just save me a long and exhausting day in the office tomorrow !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know exactly what you mean Chris. It&#039;s so frustrating when you find out simple solutions to BIG problems you face. I think software programmers need to address this by explaining outcomes during a given task. Thankfully, I&#039;m seeing this happen with newer versions of certain software. Usability is paramount!

Anyway, glad to hear it helped you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t tell you how helpful this was. I have dealt on and off with this issue for years, every time I had to move or upgrade a file server. I have searched over the years and come up with workarounds to &quot;fix&quot; the broken re-direction but never stumbled upon a simple explanation of what is, as you show, a simple fix. Mea Culpa, in that it was a silly oversight on my part and immediately obvious once you pointed it out. But I&#039;ve never seen ANYONE else point it out. This should, at the very least, be documented in a Microsoft KB article based on the number of queries I found on the Internet indicating how many people run into the same issue time and time again.

I will buy you a case of beer in whatever &quot;next life&quot; we IT people are condemned to.]]></description>
