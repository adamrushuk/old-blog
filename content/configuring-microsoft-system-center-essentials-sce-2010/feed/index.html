					<description><![CDATA[This is great but my problem here is that I want to install sce 2010 to support 10 remote sites that have about 50 to 60 clients and 2 servers the things is how do I go about installing the downstream servers as I think sce doesn&#039;t support this.......if I have to use branch caching that means I have to upgrade the member servers to R2 is there any simpler way to do this without the upgrade to R2 ?]]></description>
