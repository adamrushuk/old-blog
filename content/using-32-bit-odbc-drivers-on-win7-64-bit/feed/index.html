					<description><![CDATA[Hi Werner

I have, since I originally commented, been able to install the VFP DSN successfully thanks to exactly the same thing you just said - using the 32-bit ODBC admin. Unfortunately I forgot to share what I&#039;d found, for which I apologise.

Thank you very much for posting your findings and I hope others get to where they need to be sooner as a result of what we&#039;ve been through!

Best regards

Steve]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Werner,

I&#039;m glad my post pointed you in the right direction, but unfortunately I still have no experience with VFP. I spend most of my time with MSSQL these days.

Sounds like you sorted it yourself anyway. Good stuff!

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably no longer of interest to you, but maybe others. When I open the 32bit-ODBC manager as stated in the article above (the one from syswow64), there is a VFP driver and two other DBF-drivers (one &quot;dBase&quot; and one &quot;Access&quot;) without installing anything on Win7_64. Are you sure you used the 32bit-ODBC admin? Because in the default ODBC-admin (which is the 64bit version) from the start menu, those drivers won&#039;t show up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Steve,

I found your page when searching for a solution for exactly the same issue, but with no luck so far. After some hours of confusion, I realized there was a 32bit version of the ODBC manager, I installed the 32bit version of the mysql-connector, created a DSN with tests OK, but VFP 9 crashes big time every time I try to close the connection with sqldisconnect()... any ideas?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry Steve, I haven&#039;t had the pleasure of working with VFP yet, but I always enjoy the challenge. I&#039;ve read a few articles on using it before, but that was a while ago.

If I find anything on my travels, I&#039;ll let you know...but don&#039;t hold your breath :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny I had a similar issue just the other day.

Got any tips for adding a VFP (Visual FoxPro) DSN?

I already downloaded everything Microsoft recommended that is normally included in MDAC 2.8 and somehow managed to install it, but still the VFP option does not appear in ODBC.

Some searching about yielded an article saying that MS want the world off FoxPro and on .NET. But that seems elitist and very, well, Microsoft.

If you have any thoughts I&#039;d be glad to hear them. Thought I&#039;d ask up here in case others have seen this and would benefit from any wisdom...]]></description>
