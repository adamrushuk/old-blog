					<description><![CDATA[It worked great for me, just make sure that in the WMI query you make sure to change the &#039;64&#039; or &#039;32&#039; as specified in the write up to &quot;64&quot; or &quot;32&quot;.  This is the only place I was having troubles making it work.

Great write-up though!
